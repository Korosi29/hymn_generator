    "Jesus, keep me near the Cross",

    "Jesus, keep me near the Cross:There a precious fountain, Free to all—a healing stream—Flows from Calvary's mountain.",
    
    "In the Cross, in the Cross, be my glory ever; Till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river.",

    "Near the Cross, a trembling soul, Love and mercy found me; There the Bright and Morning Star Shed its beams around me.",

    "Near the Cross ! O Lamb of God, Bring its scenes before me; Help me walk from day to day, With its shadow o'er me.",

    "Near the Cross, I'll watch and wait. Hoping, trusting ever, Till I reach the golden strand, Just beyond the river. ",

    "I've found a friend in Jesus",

    "I've found a friend in Jesus,— He's everything to me; He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul ! The \"Lily of the Valley,\" in Him alone I see— All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole; In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay; He tells me every care on Him to roll: He's the\"Lily of the Valley,\" the \"Bright and Morning Star\"; He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul !",

    "In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay; He tells me every care on Him to roll: He's the \"Lily of the Valley,\" the \"Bright and Morning Star\"; He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul !",
    
    "He all my grief has taken, and all my sorrows borne; In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower; I've all for Him forsaken, I've all my idols torn From my heart—and now He keeps me by His power. Though all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore, Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal. He's the \"Lily of the Valley,\" the \"Bright and Morning Star\"; He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul !",
    
    "He'll never, never leave me nor yet forsake me here,  While I live by faith, and do His blessed will; A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear:  With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill. When crowned at last in glory, I'll see His blessed face,  Where rivers of delight shall ever roll. His Names and Titles He's the \"Lily of the Valley,\" the \"Bright and Morning Star\"; He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul !",
