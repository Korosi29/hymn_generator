        <h2>About This Hymn Management System</h2>
        <p>
          At <strong>Flexora</strong>, we believe worship should be <strong>organized, seamless, and deeply meaningful</strong>. 
          Under the leadership of our CEO, <strong>Hossana Korosi Maidoki</strong>, we created this <strong>Hymn Management System</strong> 
          to help churches efficiently plan and manage their hymns for every Sunday service.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Why This System?</h3>
        <p>
          Selecting hymns can sometimes feel repetitive, rushed, or unstructured. This system provides 
          <strong>a well-organized way</strong> to manage hymn selection, ensuring variety while keeping records of past hymns for better planning.
        </p>
      
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automatically suggests hymns</strong> based on previous records and themes.</li>
          <li><strong>Prevents repetition</strong> by keeping track of hymn usage.</li>
          <li><strong>Gives worship leaders and choirs a structured plan</strong> for each service.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
          With this system, we aim to take the stress out of hymn planning, allowing churches to focus on what truly mattersâ€”<strong>worship</strong>. 
          Led by <strong>Hossana Korosi Maidoki</strong>, Flexora is committed to building tools that make church administration easier and worship more impactful.
